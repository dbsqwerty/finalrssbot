A web server for https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS to manage your feeds. The backend is built with Express with server-side sessions, websockets, and a RESTful API. The front end is built with create-react-app (in ./client folder), with Redux and React Router. User authentication is done via Discord's OAuth2.

# Development:

### Backend

1. `npm install` in this directory to install backend requisites
2. Set up variables under web configuration in config.json
   - `config.web.clientId` (Bot Client ID)
   - `config.web.clientSecret` (Bot Client Secret)
   - `config.web.sessionSecret` (Set to some random string)
   - `config.web.redirectUri` (Discord OAuth2 Redirect URI - set to http://domain.xyz/authorize - replace domain what whatever yours is)
3. Start the bot normally (`node server`)

### Frontend

1. `npm install` in ./client to install frontend requisites
2. Make sure the proxy's URL port for create-react-app in ./client/package.json is set to `config.web.port`
3. If developing the Control Panel which requires OAuth2 authentication, you must authenticate yourself via the following steps:
    - Make sure the backend is running
    - Go to http://localhost:PORT/login with the PORT replaced with whatever you set in `config.web.port`
    - Authorize application to Discord
4. `npm start` in ./client
5. Go to http://localhost:CLIENT_PORT with the CLIENT_PORT replaced with `3000` (as specified in the npm start section of [web/client/README.md](https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS/blob/dev/web/client/README.md)). This is the development version over the server, not the final built one.
6. Edit the files in src/js folder
7. When finished editing, publish the development files with `npm run build` in ./client.
8. The changes are now built and live on https://localhost:PORT  where PORT is what you set in `config.web.port`


Note that if you don't do step 5, the files being served are NOT from the webpack dev server - it's from the built files from `npm run build`. For live changes, make sure to do step 5.
